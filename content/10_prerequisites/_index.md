# Workshop Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisite tasks you must perform before getting started on this workshop. We will step through each of these in turn.

## Access an AWS account
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[attending an AWS hosted event](../10_prerequisites/13_aws_event.html), or
* ...[running the workshop on your own](../10_prerequisites/14_self_paced.html)

Once you have completed with either setup and would like to setup Cloud IDE, please continue with [launching a Cloud9 IDE Workspace](../10_prerequisites/15_workspace_setup.html)
