## Sign up with Lumigo

To get started with Lumigo, take the following steps. A more detailed guide can be found at [the Lumigo documentation](https://docs.lumigo.io/docs/create-an-account).

1. Head over to https://platform.lumigo.io/signup and sign up for an account

2. Once you created your account, Lumigo will guide you through the integration. First, fill in some details.

* Next, we will link Lumigo to our AWS account. To do so all that is required is to deploy its CloudFormation stack to your account. A more detailed walkthrough of this step can be found [here](https://docs.lumigo.io/docs/connect-your-environment)

* You should land at the instrumentation step, which will let us choose functions to trace:

You can also do this after the initial setup too. Just head over to the [Functions](https://platform.lumigo.io/functions) page at any time, and you can auto-trace any function there:

Once you added tracing to the relevant Lambda functions, Lumigo will automatically start monitoring your application.
